# Recipes Project (from The Odin Project)

<strong>Start Date:</strong> 23 August 2025

This project was created during the HTML Foundations section of <em>The Odin Project</em>. It's a simple multi-page website built with only HTML to practice:
* Headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
* Images and proper alt text
* Structuring content into multiple pages
* Semantic HTML for readability

I plan to revisit and improve this project as I learn new skills (CSS, accessibility, responsive design). Over time, it will evolve into a cleaner, more polished website that recflects my progress.
